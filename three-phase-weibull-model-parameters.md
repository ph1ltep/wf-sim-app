## üéØ **DISTRIBUTION CONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGY**

### **Question: Parameter Transformation to Three-Phase Weibull**

Given all these input parameters, how do we transform it into a distribution? How does all this info translate into 3 sets of weibull shape and scale params and eventually combine into a single distribution that we can look at % probability of failure per year?

### **Answer: Three-Phase Weibull Distribution Construction**

## üéØ **CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK**

The key insight is that we're not creating one Weibull distribution, but rather **three sequential distributions** that represent different failure physics, then combining them into a **piecewise hazard function** that gives us annual failure probabilities.

## üìä **PARAMETER TRANSFORMATION LOGIC**

### **Step 1: From Inputs to Phase Boundaries**
```yaml
# Time Domain Segmentation
infant_mortality_end = 2.0  # Fixed based on manufacturing processes
useful_life_end = design_life_years √ó wear_out_start_factor  # 25 √ó 0.85 = 21.25 years
wear_out_continues = project_lifetime  # Could go to 30+ years

# Phase Duration Calculation  
phase_1_duration = infant_mortality_end
phase_2_duration = useful_life_end - infant_mortality_end  
phase_3_duration = project_lifetime - useful_life_end
```

### **Step 2: From Site/Component Inputs to Load-Adjusted Baseline**
```yaml
# Baseline Rate Transformation
adjusted_baseline_rate = (
    fleet_baseline_failure_rate √ó  
    site_load_multiplier √ó
    component_load_factor
)

# Example for SGRE SG5.0-145 Gearbox:
# 0.022 √ó 1.15 √ó 1.0 = 0.0253 adjusted baseline
```

### **Step 3: Phase-Specific Weibull Parameter Generation**

#### **Phase 1: Infant Mortality (Decreasing Hazard Rate)**
```yaml
# Weibull Parameters for Manufacturing/Installation Defects
infant_mortality_weibull:
  shape_beta_1 = 0.5 to 0.8  # Œ≤ < 1 = decreasing hazard (burn-in period)
  
  # Scale parameter from desired failure rate
  target_cumulative_failures_2yr = adjusted_baseline_rate √ó infant_mortality_rate_factor √ó 2
  # For our example: 0.0253 √ó 0.5 √ó 2 = 0.0253 cumulative probability by year 2
  
  scale_eta_1 = solve_for_eta(target_cumulative = 0.0253, beta = 0.7, time = 2)
  # eta_1 ‚âà 15.8 years (but most failures occur in first 2 years due to Œ≤ < 1)
```

#### **Phase 2: Useful Life (Constant Hazard Rate)**  
```yaml
# Exponential Distribution (Special Case of Weibull with Œ≤ = 1)
useful_life_weibull:
  shape_beta_2 = 1.0  # Constant hazard rate (random failures)
  
  # Scale parameter directly from annual rate
  annual_rate_phase_2 = adjusted_baseline_rate
  scale_eta_2 = 1 / annual_rate_phase_2
  # For our example: eta_2 = 1/0.0253 = 39.5 years
```

#### **Phase 3: Wear-Out (Increasing Hazard Rate)**
```yaml  
# Weibull Parameters for Fatigue/Aging Failures
wear_out_weibull:
  shape_beta_3 = 2.5 to 3.5  # Œ≤ > 1 = increasing hazard (aging)
  
  # Acceleration factor applied
  target_rate_at_design_life = adjusted_baseline_rate √ó wear_out_acceleration_factor
  # 0.0253 √ó 2.5 = 0.0633 annual rate at year 25
  
  # Scale parameter calibrated to hit target rate at specific time
  scale_eta_3 = calibrate_eta(target_rate = 0.0633, beta = 3.0, time_from_phase_start = 4)
  # eta_3 ‚âà 12 years (from start of wear-out phase)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **DISTRIBUTION COMBINATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Approach: Piecewise Hazard Function (Not Mixed Distribution)**

We **don't** create a single mixed Weibull. Instead, we create a **time-dependent hazard function**:

```yaml
# Hazard Rate Function h(t)
hazard_rate(year):
  if year ‚â§ 2:
    return weibull_hazard(year, beta_1, eta_1)
  elif year ‚â§ 21.25:  
    return weibull_hazard(year-2, beta_2, eta_2)  # Reset time origin
  else:
    return weibull_hazard(year-21.25, beta_3, eta_3)  # Reset time origin

# Annual Failure Probability from Hazard Rate
annual_failure_probability(year) = hazard_rate(year)  # For small rates

# OR more precisely:
annual_failure_probability(year) = 1 - exp(-hazard_rate(year))
```

### **Survival Function Construction**
```yaml
# Cumulative Survival (Probability of NO failure by year t)
survival_function(year):
  if year ‚â§ 2:
    S1 = exp(-integrate(hazard_rate, 0, year))
  elif year ‚â§ 21.25:
    S1 = exp(-integrate(hazard_rate_phase1, 0, 2))  # Survived phase 1
    S2 = exp(-integrate(hazard_rate_phase2, 2, year))  # Surviving phase 2  
    return S1 √ó S2
  else:
    S1 = exp(-integrate(hazard_rate_phase1, 0, 2))
    S2 = exp(-integrate(hazard_rate_phase2, 2, 21.25))  
    S3 = exp(-integrate(hazard_rate_phase3, 21.25, year))
    return S1 √ó S2 √ó S3

# Annual Failure Probability
annual_failure_prob(year) = survival_function(year-1) - survival_function(year)
```

## üîç **PARAMETER CALIBRATION PROCESS**

### **Working Backwards from Target Behavior**

```yaml
# Desired Behavior Pattern (Example)
target_annual_rates:
  year_1: 0.011    # 50% of baseline (infant mortality)
  year_10: 0.025   # Baseline rate (useful life)  
  year_25: 0.063   # 2.5x baseline (wear-out)

# Calibration Process:
step_1_infant_mortality:
  # Choose Œ≤‚ÇÅ = 0.7 (decreasing hazard)  
  # Solve for Œ∑‚ÇÅ such that average rate years 1-2 = 0.011
  
step_2_useful_life:
  # Set Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1.0 (constant hazard)
  # Set Œ∑‚ÇÇ = 1/0.025 = 40 years
  
step_3_wear_out:
  # Choose Œ≤‚ÇÉ = 3.0 (increasing hazard)
  # Solve for Œ∑‚ÇÉ such that rate at year 4 of wear-out phase = 0.063
```

### **Site/Component Factor Integration**
```yaml
# How Site Factors Modify Weibull Parameters:

turbulence_impact:
  # Higher turbulence increases load cycling
  if TI_ratio > 1.0:
    beta_3 += 0.5 √ó (TI_ratio - 1)  # Steeper wear-out curve
    eta_1 /= TI_ratio^0.5           # Earlier infant mortality
    
temperature_cycling_impact:
  # Thermal stress affects all phases
  thermal_factor = (temp_range_actual / temp_range_design)^2
  eta_2 /= thermal_factor           # Shorter useful life
  beta_3 += 0.3 √ó (thermal_factor - 1)  # More aggressive wear-out

component_specific_adjustments:
  if component == "gearbox":
    # Bearing L10 life dominates wear-out phase
    bearing_life_years = bearing_L10_hours / (8760 √ó capacity_factor)  
    eta_3 = bearing_life_years √ó 0.8  # Scale parameter tied to L10
    
  if component == "blade_set" and material == "CFRP":
    beta_3 = 4.0  # Steeper failure curve for composites
    lightning_additional_rate = lightning_probability √ó 0.1
```

## üéØ **FINAL OUTPUT GENERATION**

### **Year-by-Year Calculation Process**
```yaml
# For each year 1 to 30:
for year in range(1, 31):
  
  # Step 1: Determine which phase
  if year ‚â§ infant_mortality_end:
    phase = "infant_mortality"
    t_phase = year
    beta, eta = beta_1, eta_1
    
  elif year ‚â§ useful_life_end:  
    phase = "useful_life"
    t_phase = year - infant_mortality_end
    beta, eta = beta_2, eta_2
    
  else:
    phase = "wear_out"  
    t_phase = year - useful_life_end
    beta, eta = beta_3, eta_3
  
  # Step 2: Calculate hazard rate for this phase
  hazard = (beta / eta) √ó (t_phase / eta)^(beta - 1)
  
  # Step 3: Convert to annual failure probability
  annual_failure_prob[year] = 1 - exp(-hazard)
  
  # Step 4: Apply component-specific adjustments
  if component == "gearbox" and oil_temp > threshold:
    annual_failure_prob[year] *= 3.0
```

## üí° **KEY INSIGHTS**

### **Why Three Phases Work**
1. **Different Physics**: Manufacturing defects vs. random failures vs. fatigue damage
2. **Different Time Scales**: Days/months vs. years vs. decades  
3. **Different Sensitivities**: Installation quality vs. operating conditions vs. cumulative damage
4. **Different Predictability**: Known burn-in vs. steady state vs. accelerating degradation

### **Critical Design Decisions**
```yaml
phase_boundaries:
  infant_mortality_end: "Fixed at 2 years" # Based on industry experience
  wear_out_start: "85% of design life"     # IEC fatigue methodology
  
parameter_hierarchy:
  most_critical: "wear_out_start_factor"   # Drives economics
  most_sensitive: "turbulence_intensity"   # Cubic relationship  
  most_uncertain: "beta_3 (wear-out shape)" # Limited field data
  
validation_targets:
  industry_benchmarks: "Match fleet failure rates by age"
  physics_consistency: "Monotonic hazard in wear-out phase"  
  financial_realism: "P90 costs within financing limits"
```

The beauty of this approach is that all our complex site conditions and component parameters ultimately flow into just **six Weibull parameters** (Œ≤‚ÇÅ,Œ∑‚ÇÅ,Œ≤‚ÇÇ,Œ∑‚ÇÇ,Œ≤‚ÇÉ,Œ∑‚ÇÉ) that capture the complete lifecycle reliability behavior, but the calculation process gives us the annual failure probabilities we need for Monte Carlo financial modeling.

## üîç **CALIBRATION REALISM & DATA INTEGRATION CHALLENGES**

### **Questions: Data Availability & Model Calibration**

There are a lot of correlation factors, component specific inputs and calibration parameters. How do we get this as right as possible? For example, for the site calibration stuff, how realistic are your factors and will this change at every site or is somewhat predictably related to each other? Do we have enough industry/expert data to make decent estimates? Also, if we have fleet data to for the same part of the WTG's lifetime, how could we add a calibration to this mechanism. What if we wanted to extrapolate the remaining life based on the first few years of a existing project (rather than arbritrary fleet data that certainly have different site parameters)?

### **Answer: Critical Assessment & Revised Approach**

## üéØ **CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: DATA AVAILABILITY & REALISM**

### **Site Correlation Factor Reality Check**

The correlation factors I proposed are **oversimplified** and need significant refinement:

#### **Current Proposal Issues:**
```yaml
# PROBLEMATIC: Independent multipliers
high_turbulence_sites: 1.4    # Too simplistic
complex_terrain: 1.3          # Ignores correlations  
offshore: 1.1                 # Based on limited data
cold_climate: 1.2             # Threshold effects ignored
```

#### **Reality: Site Factors Are Highly Correlated**
```yaml
# BETTER: Correlated site characterization
site_complexity_matrix:
  flat_onshore_low_TI:        # Baseline case
    turbulence: 0.12-0.16
    terrain_factor: 1.0
    accessibility: 1.0
    failure_multiplier: 0.85   # Actually lower than "standard"
    
  complex_onshore_high_TI:    # Mountain/ridge sites  
    turbulence: 0.18-0.24      # Correlated with terrain
    terrain_factor: 1.4
    accessibility: 0.7         # Limited crane access
    failure_multiplier: 1.8    # Combined effect, not additive
    
  offshore_moderate_TI:       # Marine environment
    turbulence: 0.14-0.18      # Actually lower over water
    corrosion_acceleration: 2.5 # Dominant factor
    accessibility: 0.3         # Weather windows
    failure_multiplier: 1.3    # Dominated by logistics, not loads
```

  step_1_initialize:
    # Start with physics-based priors
    source: "First principles + IEC standards"
    confidence: "Medium for load relationships, low for failure rates"

```

## üéØ **REVISED MODEL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Changes to Original Proposal**

#### **1. Replace Independent Site Multipliers with Site Archetypes**
```yaml
# BEFORE: Independent factors
site_factors = TI_factor √ó terrain_factor √ó climate_factor

# AFTER: Site archetype classification
site_archetype_parameters:
  archetype_1_simple_onshore:
    turbulence_range: [0.12, 0.16]
    load_multiplier: 0.90
    accessibility_factor: 1.0
    primary_failure_modes: ["bearing_wear", "fatigue"]
    
  archetype_2_complex_onshore:
    turbulence_range: [0.18, 0.24]
    load_multiplier: 1.60          # Non-linear interaction
    accessibility_factor: 0.70
    primary_failure_modes: ["fatigue", "extreme_loads", "lightning"]
    
  archetype_3_offshore:
    turbulence_range: [0.14, 0.18]
    load_multiplier: 1.20
    accessibility_factor: 0.40     # Weather windows dominate
    primary_failure_modes: ["corrosion", "bearing_wear"]
```

#### **2. Uncertainty Quantification Throughout**
```yaml
# Every parameter gets uncertainty bounds
parameter_structure:
  value: 0.022                    # Point estimate
  distribution: "lognormal"       # Parameter uncertainty distribution
  confidence_interval: [0.018, 0.027]  # 95% CI
  data_source: "WMEP + VTT"      # Traceability
  last_updated: "2024-01-15"
  sample_size: 1247              # Underlying data quality
```

#### **3. Dynamic Calibration Interface**
```yaml
calibration_api:
  # Method signatures for different calibration approaches
  
  initialize_from_physics():
    # Pure physics-based initialization
    confidence: "LOW-MEDIUM"
    use_case: "New component types, no historical data"
    
  calibrate_from_fleet(fleet_database, site_archetype):
    # Industry-wide calibration
    confidence: "MEDIUM"  
    use_case: "Standard components, similar sites"
    
  calibrate_from_project(project_failures, operational_years):
    # Project-specific calibration
    confidence: "HIGH for observed phases"
    use_case: "Existing projects, remaining life estimation"
    
  update_with_new_data(new_failures, current_model):
    # Continuous improvement
    method: "Bayesian updating"
    use_case: "Model maintenance, ongoing projects"
```

## üîç **VALIDATION & REALITY CHECKING**

### **Model Validation Framework**
```yaml
validation_requirements:
  
  statistical_validation:
    # Standard statistical tests
    kolmogorov_smirnov: "Distribution shape validation"
    likelihood_ratio: "Model comparison"
    cross_validation: "Out-of-sample prediction accuracy"
    
  industry_benchmarks:
    # Must reproduce known industry patterns
    component_failure_ranking: "Gearbox > Generator > Bearing > Blades"
    age_related_trends: "Low early, flat middle, increasing late"
    site_type_differences: "Offshore > Complex > Simple onshore"
    
  physics_consistency:
    # Must respect physical laws
    monotonic_wear_out: "Hazard rate increases in phase 3"
    load_sensitivity: "Higher loads ‚Üí higher failure rates"
    temperature_relationships: "Arrhenius behavior for thermal effects"
    
  financial_realism:
    # Results must make economic sense
    p90_cost_estimates: "Within typical financing limits"
    maintenance_optimization: "Predicts optimal replacement timing"
    insurance_pricing: "Consistent with actuarial models"
```

## üí° **PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Implementation Strategy**
```yaml
phase_1_minimum_viable_model:
  # What we can build with current data limitations
  scope: "Major components, onshore sites only"
  parameters: "Physics-based + limited fleet calibration"
  uncertainty: "Explicitly quantified and communicated"
  validation: "Against available historical data"
  
phase_2_enhanced_calibration:
  # As more data becomes available
  fleet_partnerships: "Partner with OEMs/operators for data sharing"
  site_monitoring: "Detailed measurement campaigns"
  component_testing: "Accelerated aging studies"
  
phase_3_predictive_maintenance:
  # Ultimate goal
  real_time_updates: "SCADA integration for condition monitoring"
  machine_learning: "Pattern recognition in operational data"
  digital_twins: "Component-specific models"
```

### **Critical Success Factors**
1. **Honest Uncertainty Communication**: Don't oversell model accuracy
2. **Continuous Calibration**: Model improves as data accumulates  
3. **Physics Foundation**: Maintain physical realism even with limited data
4. **Practical Validation**: Focus on decisions that matter to wind farm economics
5. **Industry Partnerships**: Critical for accessing proprietary failure data

The key insight is that we need to **start with what we can validate** (physics-based relationships, basic site effects) and **build calibration capability** that improves the model as more data becomes available, rather than trying to achieve perfect accuracy from day one with insufficient data.

## üî¨ **REFINED COMPONENT FAILURE RATE SIMULATOR ARCHITECTURE**

### **Questions: Enhanced Input Requirements & Scope Refinement**

For corrosion rate, do we need to add inputs for salinity and humidity? These are easy to obtain especially if we're not too exactly sensitive. Weather data can provide it.

What other direct from OEM specs would we need for the other major components? For example, clearly blade length is a must.

For the monte-carlo integration data flow, I don't want to simulate the entire wind farm or WTG. I want to limit it to simulating the component failure probability per year. The app already ties everything together to simulate the business case.

The goal of this brainstorming is not related to a specific business case, so reaching specific IRRs or bps doesn't matter. We want to focus on building the realistic and capable failure rate simulator we can. The app does the rest.

### **Answer: Enhanced Physics-Based Approach**

## üåç **ENHANCED SITE DATA UTILIZATION**

### **Corrosion-Specific Inputs** (Easily Obtainable from Weather Data)

```yaml
enhanced_environmental_inputs:
  # Existing site data
  turbulence_intensity: 0.16
  mean_wind_speed: 8.0
  temperature_range: [-20, 40]
  rainfall_mm_year: 800
  
  # ADDED: Corrosion-critical factors
  salinity_level: "low" | "moderate" | "high" | "marine"  # Distance from coast classification
  relative_humidity_avg: 0.65        # Standard weather station data
  uv_radiation_index: 6.5            # Solar radiation data (affects polymers)
  
# Enhanced corrosion rate physics calculation
corrosion_acceleration = base_rate √ó humidity_factor √ó salinity_factor √ó temperature_factor
where:
  humidity_factor = (RH_actual / 0.65)^1.5      # Exponential relationship
  salinity_factor = {"low": 1.0, "moderate": 1.5, "high": 2.5, "marine": 4.0}
  temperature_factor = exp((T_avg - 15) / 25)   # Arrhenius-type acceleration
