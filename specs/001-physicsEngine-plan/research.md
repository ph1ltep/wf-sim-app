# Research: Physics Engine for Three-Phase Weibull Component Failure Modeling

## Integration Pattern Research

### Decision: Wrapper Service Architecture
**Rationale**: Based on implementation guide recommendation for "Physics API" that preprocesses → calls simulation API → postprocesses
**Integration Flow**: Frontend → Physics API → (preprocessing) → Monte Carlo API → (postprocessing) → Response
**Benefits**:
- Non-breaking integration with existing monte-carlo-v2 service
- Maintains existing simulation API patterns
- Allows physics calculations to be cached and optimized separately

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct integration into monte-carlo-v2: Rejected due to complexity and risk of breaking existing functionality
- Separate microservice: Rejected due to operational overhead and network latency
- Frontend calculation: Rejected due to scientific formula complexity and performance requirements

### Decision: Express.js Service Extension
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing backend architecture, minimal deployment changes
**Implementation**: Extend backend/src/services/ with physics/ subdirectory
**Benefits**:
- Leverages existing Express middleware, error handling, and MongoDB connection
- Uses established authentication and request validation patterns
- Consistent logging and monitoring

**Alternatives Considered**:
- FastAPI (Python): Rejected due to different runtime and deployment requirements
- Standalone Node.js server: Rejected due to duplicated infrastructure setup

## Physics Formula Implementation Research

### Decision: Scientific Formula Validation Against Industry Standards
**Rationale**: Implementation guide specifies IEC 61400-1, ISO 281, AGMA standards for credibility
**Key Formulas Validated**:
- Turbulence load factor: `Math.pow(turbulenceIntensity / designRef, 3)` (IEC 61400-1 cube law)
- Temperature cycling: Coffin-Manson-Arrhenius equations (JEDEC JESD94A)
- Corrosion acceleration: ISO 9223:2012 atmospheric corrosion standard
- Wind shear effects: IEC 61400-1 Annex B rotor asymmetric loading

**Benefits**:
- Scientifically accurate predictions matching SGRE fleet data within ±15%
- Industry-standard formulas provide credibility for financial modeling
- Validated against academic research and operational data

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simplified statistical models: Rejected due to lack of scientific accuracy
- Machine learning approaches: Rejected due to lack of interpretability and training data requirements
- Generic Weibull distributions: Rejected due to inability to account for environmental factors

### Decision: IEC Class Parameter System
**Rationale**: Implementation guide specifies design reference values based on wind turbine class
**Implementation**: IEC_CLASS_PARAMETERS lookup table with vref, turbulence, temperature ranges
**Benefits**:
- Proper load factor calculations relative to design baselines
- Support for site-specific Class S turbines
- Eliminates hard-coded reference values in physics formulas

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fixed reference values: Rejected due to inaccuracy across different turbine classes
- User-specified references: Rejected due to complexity and error potential
- Statistical averaging: Rejected due to loss of design-specific accuracy

## Data Model Architecture Research

### Decision: Extended Classes Pattern for Physics Models
**Rationale**: Implementation guide recommends following monte-carlo-v2/distributions pattern
**Structure**: PhysicsModelBase class with validate(), getMetadata(), execute() methods
**Benefits**:
- Consistent with existing distribution architecture
- Supports auto-discovery and extensibility for future physics models
- Shared functionality for validation, continuity constraints, error handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple function exports: Rejected due to lack of shared functionality and metadata
- Configuration-driven approach: Rejected due to complexity of physics formula validation
- Plugin architecture: Rejected as overkill for initial implementation

### Decision: Three-Phase Continuity Constraints
**Rationale**: Implementation guide specifies phase continuity requirements for realistic transitions
**Implementation**: `solveForContinuity()` function ensuring smooth hazard rate transitions
**Benefits**:
- Eliminates unrealistic failure rate jumps between phases
- Maintains mathematical integrity of Weibull distributions
- Provides industry-validated failure patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Independent phase parameters: Rejected due to discontinuity issues
- Linear interpolation: Rejected due to mathematical incorrectness
- Fixed transition points: Rejected due to inflexibility across components

## Performance Optimization Research

### Decision: Load Factor Caching Strategy
**Rationale**: Environmental load factors are expensive to calculate but deterministic
**Implementation**: In-memory cache keyed by environmental parameter hash
**Benefits**:
- Sub-100ms response times for repeated calculations
- Reduces CPU usage for identical environmental conditions
- Supports concurrent request handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database caching: Rejected due to I/O overhead
- No caching: Rejected due to performance requirements (<2000ms)
- Redis caching: Rejected as premature optimization for initial implementation

### Decision: Component-Specific Parameter Validation
**Rationale**: Implementation guide specifies different physics parameters per component type
**Implementation**: Validation schemas per component (gearbox, generator, blades)
**Benefits**:
- Type-safe parameter handling with meaningful error messages
- Prevents incorrect parameter application across components
- Supports extensibility for new component types

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Generic parameter validation: Rejected due to lack of type safety
- Runtime parameter discovery: Rejected due to complexity and error potential
- Schema-less approach: Rejected due to validation requirements

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: Contract-First Testing with Physics Validation
**Rationale**: Enables TDD approach while ensuring scientific accuracy
**Implementation**:
- Contract tests for API endpoints with sample calculations
- Physics formula unit tests against known benchmarks
- Integration tests with monte-carlo-v2 service

**Benefits**:
- Early detection of integration issues
- Scientific accuracy validation against SGRE benchmarks
- Regression protection for physics calculations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Implementation-first testing: Rejected due to TDD requirements
- Manual testing only: Rejected due to scientific accuracy requirements
- End-to-end testing only: Rejected due to complexity of debugging failures
