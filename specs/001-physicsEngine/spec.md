## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Wind farm analysts need to generate scientifically-accurate component failure rate predictions based on site-specific environmental conditions and turbine specifications. The system should automatically calculate three-phase Weibull distributions that account for infant mortality, useful life, and wear-out phases using physics-based formulas validated against industry standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a wind farm scenario with environmental parameters (turbulence, temperature, humidity), **When** the analyst selects three-phase Weibull modeling for gearbox components, **Then** the system generates failure rate distributions based on physics calculations incorporating bearing life, oil temperature, and gear fatigue factors
2. **Given** different IEC turbine classes (IA, IIB, IIIA, etc.), **When** physics modeling is applied, **Then** the system uses appropriate design reference parameters for each class to calculate load factors accurately
3. **Given** site-specific environmental conditions that exceed design parameters, **When** failure rates are calculated, **Then** the system applies appropriate load multipliers based on scientific formulas (turbulence cube law, temperature cycling, corrosion acceleration)
4. **Given** multiple component types (gearbox, generator, blades), **When** physics modeling is enabled, **Then** each component uses its specific physics parameters and calculation methods while maintaining continuity constraints between failure phases

### Edge Cases
- What happens when environmental parameters are missing or invalid?
- How does the system handle extreme environmental conditions outside typical operational ranges?
- What occurs when component specifications don't match expected physics parameter ranges?
- How does the system respond when physics calculations result in unrealistic failure rates?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST calculate three-phase Weibull parameters (shape and scale for each phase) based on environmental load factors and component specifications
- **FR-002**: System MUST apply physics-based load factor calculations using industry-validated formulas (IEC 61400-1, ISO 281, AGMA standards)
- **FR-003**: System MUST support component-specific physics parameters for gearboxes (bearing L10 life, oil temperature, gear stages), generators (insulation class, cooling method), and blades (fatigue limit, surface treatment)
- **FR-004**: System MUST use IEC turbine class design reference parameters (vref, turbulence intensity, temperature range) for proper load factor calculations
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure phase continuity constraints so failure rate transitions smoothly between infant mortality, useful life, and wear-out phases
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate input parameters against acceptable ranges and provide meaningful error messages for invalid configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate failure rate distributions compatible with existing Monte Carlo simulation engine
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide fallback to simplified models when physics calculations fail or parameters are incomplete
- **FR-009**: System MUST calculate environmental load factors for turbulence (cube law relationship), temperature cycling (Coffin-Manson), corrosion (humidity and salinity), and wind shear effects
- **FR-010**: System MUST support site-specific parameter overrides for IEC Class S turbines while maintaining calculation accuracy

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Physics Model**: Represents a specific failure modeling approach (three-phase Weibull) with validation rules, input requirements, and calculation methods
- **Environmental Parameters**: Site conditions including wind speed, turbulence intensity, temperature range, humidity, salinity level, and wind shear that affect component loading
- **Component Specifications**: Physical and operational characteristics of wind turbine components (bearing ratings, material properties, design limits) used in physics calculations
- **IEC Class Parameters**: Standard design reference values for different wind turbine classes that serve as baselines for load factor calculations
- **Load Factors**: Environmental and operational multipliers that adjust base failure rates based on actual vs design conditions
- **Phase Parameters**: Shape and scale parameters for each of the three Weibull distribution phases (infant mortality, useful life, wear-out) with continuity constraints
