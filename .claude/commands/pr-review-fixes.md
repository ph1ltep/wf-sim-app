11. **CRITICAL**: Establish issue checklist as single source of truth for overall progress
12. Ask clarifying questions about any ambiguous feedback if necessary

# CONTEXT

2. **Comment-to-Checklist Mapping**: Map PR review comments to corresponding issue checklist items
3. **Checklist Updates**: Update issue checklist based on new findings from PR review feedback
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify review feedback that doesn't map to existing checklist items (add new items if needed)
5. **Previous Actions Review**: Analyze any previous AI action logs to avoid duplicate work
6. **Systematic Addressing**: Plan how to address each review comment with clear traceability to issue checklist
7. **Task Breakdown**: Break down requested changes into small, manageable tasks that align with checklist items
8. **Priority Matrix**: Prioritize based on checklist item importance, reviewer feedback severity, and dependencies  
9. **Conflict Resolution**: Identify potential conflicts between reviewer suggestions and issue requirements

11. **Issue-Centric Tracking**: Prepare structure for maintaining issue checklist as primary progress indicator

# IMPLEMENT - WITH ISSUE CHECKLIST SYNC
- **Branch Management**: Stay on the current PR branch (do not create a new branch)
- **Issue-First Implementation**: Address review comments in logical steps that align with issue checklist items
- **Checklist Updates**: After each significant change, update the linked issue checklist to reflect completed items

- **Continuous Sync**: Push changes to server and update issue status after each commit

# TEST  
- Ask if we should run tests, and wait for a response. If No, skip TEST section here.
- IMPORTANT: Use Playwright MCP to run UI tests if changes affect the UI
- Write or update Playwright tests if reviewer requested test coverage
- Run the full test suite to ensure fixes don't break existing functionality
- If tests fail, fix them before proceeding
- Ensure all tests pass before finalizing changes
- Use documentation-manager to update any relevant documentation mentioned in reviews
- When making changes to schema definitions in @schemas/yup, restart the frontend for changes to take effect
