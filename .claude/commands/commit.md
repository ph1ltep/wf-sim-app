# Claude Command: Commit

This command helps you create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages and emoji.

## Usage

```
/commit
/commit --verify
```

## What This Command Does

1. When specified with `--verify`, automatically runs pre-commit checks:
   - `pnpm lint` to ensure code quality
   - `pnpm build` to verify the build succeeds
   - `pnpm generate:docs` to update documentation
2. Checks which files are staged with `git status`
3. If 0 files are staged, automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`
4. Performs a `git diff` to understand what changes are being committed
5. Analyzes the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present
6. If multiple distinct changes are detected, suggests breaking the commit into multiple smaller commits
7. For each commit (or the single commit if not split), creates a commit message using emoji conventional commit format

## Best Practices for Commits
- **CRITICAL**: follow rules in @.claude/references/git-conventional-commits.md

## Command Options

- `--verify`: Run the pre-commit checks (lint, build, generate:docs)

## Important Notes

- By default no pre-commit checks. When --verify is used, pre-commit checks (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm generate:docs`) will run to ensure code quality
- If these checks fail, you'll be asked if you want to proceed with the commit anyway or fix the issues first
- If specific files are already staged, the command will only commit those files
- If no files are staged, it will automatically stage all modified and new files
- The commit message will be constructed based on the changes detected
- Before committing, the command will review the diff to identify if multiple commits would be more appropriate
- If suggesting multiple commits, it will help you stage and commit the changes separately
- Always reviews the commit diff to ensure the message matches the changes
- **NEVER add Claude signature to commits**
