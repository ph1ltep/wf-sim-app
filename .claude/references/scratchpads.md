# Best practices for checklists, scratchpads, and tracking progress.

- **Use scratchpad files**: a working scratchpad you can modify as often as needed to keep track of the latest agreed ideas, decisions, way-forward, ToDos, Unaswered questions, and more.
  - It's NOT a history: it should reflect the latest understanding, and not a sequence of events.
  - Create and store in @.claude/scratchpads/
  - Include the idea or issue name in the filename
  - If it's a git issue, include a link to the issue in the scratchpad.
  - When issues are closed and PRs accepted, clean up the scratchpad.
  - Use markdown format as much as possible.

## Converting scratchpads to git issues
- **When requested to create a git issue**:
  - Optimize the scratchpad to contain all the necessary information for a well-structured git issue that we can use to the develop the feature as intended.
  - add reference and link to the issue to the scratchpad and move it to /issues folder.
  - include the scratchpad file name in the git issue, so it's clear which scratchpad to reference and use in the future.

- **When updating git issues**:
  - As we make changes to an idea that already has a git issue, we MUST maintain the git issue updated with the latest agreed path.

- **IMPORTANT**: clean up after yourself and delete unneeded, outdated scratchpads often.
